##  The Unity Message

### Philosophy

This game teaches a simple truth: **our divisions are human, but our unity is divine**.

All religions come from history, geography, and culture. Our differences are real  but they don't have to divide us. What if we:

- **Respected** every path while walking our own?
- **Understood** without needing to agree?
- **Loved** beyond tribal boundaries?

### Seven Steps to Peace

1. **Recognize**  Our boundaries come from the past
2. **Respect**  Foundation of peace
3. **Understand**  Listen without judging
4. **Transform Yourself**  Be the change
5. **Break Free**  From "us vs. them" thinking
6. **Liberate Others**  Through example
7. **Seek Meaning**  In spirit, not just words

> *"That all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you."*  
>  John 17:21
