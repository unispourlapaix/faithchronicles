    emmanuelMemo: "Emmanuel's Memo",
    emmanuelMessage: "You have reached the mountain top, and knowledge is acquired. But unwavering faith requires life experience, mercy, and true love of Jesus. Life's various trials will test your path, the true way we choose, our heart. We remain imperfect, our desires are many, and love of gain or personal comfort too often becomes our selfish priority. Ask God for wisdom, His love, His strength, and humbly acknowledge your weaknesses, for we can hide nothing from Him... Nothing. No need to browse in private mode, use VPN, or even clear history. Fast like Daniel: deprive yourself for a moment of what you love most, in calm and wisdom. This will allow you to better hear God, to have a heart disposition ready for profound — and often painful — transformations. Then dreams and visions will become clearer, as with Joseph. But guard against pride: do not yield to 'I'm always right' or 'I know better.' For God's revelation is an extraordinary grace. Don't become a teacher of the Law, capable of crucifying Jesus again today, He who simply asks to love your neighbor... and grant them the same freedom you yourself receive. Having faith means entering into a relationship and a free journey of the heart. It will make you powerful heroes, capable of the impossible. For the experience of the supernatural, God's presence, His confirmation or blessing will make you truly unshakeable.",
