    emmanuelMessage: "You have reached the top of the mountain, and knowledge is acquired. But unshakeable faith requires life experience, mercy and true love of Jesus. The various trials of life will test your way, the true path we choose, our heart. We remain imperfect, our desires are numerous, and the love of gain or our personal comfort too often becomes our selfish priority. Ask God for wisdom, his love, his strength, and humbly acknowledge your weaknesses, for nothing can be hidden from Him... Nothing. No need to travel in private mode, VPN, or even delete history. Fast like Daniel: deprive yourself for a moment of what you love most, in calm and wisdom. This will allow you to better hear God, to have a heart disposition ready for deep - and often painful - transformations. Then dreams and visions will become clearer, like for Joseph. But guard against pride: do not give in to 'I'm always right' or 'I know better.' For God's revelation is an extraordinary grace. Do not become a doctor of the Law, capable of crucifying Jesus again today, He who simply asks to love your neighbor... and grant them the same freedom you receive. Having faith means entering into a free relationship and journey of the heart. It will make you powerful heroes, capable of the impossible. For the experience of the supernatural, God's presence, his confirmation or blessing will make you truly unshakeable.",
